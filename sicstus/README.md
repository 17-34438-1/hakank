Here are some of my SICStus Prolog models. The models contains presentation of the problem, references, 
and links to comparison models in other constraint programming systems.

Note: Many of these models use the new and excellent feature of logical loops (do-loops) which was introduced 
in SICStus Prolog 4.1.
