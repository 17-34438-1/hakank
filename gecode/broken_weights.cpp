/*  
  Broken weights problem in Gecode.
  
  From
  http://www.mathlesstraveled.com/?p=701
  """
  Here's a fantastic problem I recently heard. Apparently it was first 
  posed by Claude Gaspard Bachet de MÃ©ziriac in a book of arithmetic problems 
  published in 1612, and can also be found in Heinrich Dorrie's 100 
  Great Problems of Elementary Mathematics.
  
      A merchant had a forty pound measuring weight that broke 
      into four pieces as the result of a fall. When the pieces were 
      subsequently weighed, it was found that the weight of each piece 
      was a whole number of pounds and that the four pieces could be 
      used to weigh every integral weight between 1 and 40 pounds. What 
      were the weights of the pieces?
  
  Note that since this was a 17th-century merchant, he of course used a 
  balance scale to weigh things. So, for example, he could use a 1-pound 
  weight and a 4-pound weight to weigh a 3-pound object, by placing the 
  3-pound object and 1-pound weight on one side of the scale, and 
  the 4-pound weight on the other side.
