Here are some of my SWI Prologr programs/models. It should be a replica
of the files at http://hakank.org/swi_prolog/ .

The models contains presentation of the problem, references, 
and links to comparison models in other constraint programming systems.

Note: Most - if not all - programs includes the module hakank_utils.pl which should be downloaded as well.
