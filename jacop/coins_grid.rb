# Coins grid problem in Gecode/R
#
# Problem from 
# Tony HÃ¼rlimann: "A coin puzzle - SVOR-contest 2007"
# http://www.svor.ch/competitions/competition2007/AsroContestSolution.pdf
#
# """
# In a quadratic grid (or a larger chessboard) with 31x31 cells, one should 
# place coins in such a way that the following conditions are fulfilled:
#    1. In each row exactly 14 coins must be placed.
#    2. In each column exactly 14 coins must be placed.
#    3. The sum of the quadratic horizontal distance from the main diagonal 
#       of all cells containing a coin must be as small as possible.
#    4. In each cell at most one coin can be placed.
#
# The description says to place 14x31 = 434 coins on the chessboard each 
# row containing 14 coins and each column also containing 14 coins.
# """
#
#
# This model is quite slow (cf Gecode/flatzinc below): The problem
# for n = 8, c = 4 takes about 11 seconds! This is about the same
# time as Gecode/flatzinc for a MiniZinc model.
# 
#
# Compare with the following model
#
# - LPL model (LPL is Hurlimann's constraint solving system)
#   http://diuflx71.unifr.ch/lpl/GetModel?name=/puzzles/coin
#   which solves the problem very fast.
#
# Or my other models:
# 
# - MiniZinc model: http://www.hakank.org/minizinc/coins_grid.mzn
#   The linear programming solvers, e.g ECLiPSe/eplex and MiniZinc/mip
#   are very fast. Gecode/flatzinc, ECLiPSe/ic, MiniZinc/minizinc are
#   slow.

# - Choco model: http:// www.hakank.org/choco/CoinsGrid.java
