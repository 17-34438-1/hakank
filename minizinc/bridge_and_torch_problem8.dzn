%  <h4>The U2 problem</h4>
% 
% "U2" has a Christmas concert that starts in 17 minutes and they must
%  all cross a bridge to get there.  All four men begin on the same side
%  of the bridge.  You must help them across to the other side. It is
%  night. There is one flashlight.  A maximum of two people can cross at
%  one time.  Any party who crosses, either 1 or 2 people, must have the
%  flashlight with them.  The flashlight must be walked back and forth,
%  it cannot be thrown, etc.  Each band member walks at a different
%  speed.  A pair must walk together at the rate of the slower man's
%  pace:
% 
%            <ul>
%            <li> Bono:- 1 minute to cross
%            <li> Edge:- 2 minutes to cross
%            <li> Adam:- 5 minutes to cross
%            <li> Larry:-10 minutes to cross
%            </ul>
% 
%  For example: if Bono and Larry walk across first, 10 minutes have
%  elapsed when they get to the other side of the bridge.  If Larry then
%  returns with the flashlight, a total of 20 minutes have passed and you
%  have failed the mission.  Notes: There is no trick behind this.  It is
%  the simple movement of resources in the appropriate order.  There are
%  two known answers to this problem.  This is based on a question
%  Microsoft gives to all prospective employees.  <br>
%  <i>Note</i>: Microsoft expects
%  you to answer this question in under 5 minutes!  Good Luck!  REMEMBER
%  - all the parameters you need to solve the problem are given to you!
%  That means all 4 guys ARE AT THE OTHER SIDE in 17 minutes. 2 guys at a
%  time MAX on the bridge at any time AND they HAVE to have the ONE
%  flashlight with them.
