% Bin packing as a scheduling problem.
%
% Here we see the bin packing as a scheduling problem (with
% assignments) as follows:
%   - the number of things to pack is the number of jobs
%   - the capacity of each bin is the number of workers
%   - the weight/height of each thing is the resource
%   - all durations is set to 1
%   - max_time is the number of workers
%   - the minimum number of bins to use (to be minimized) 
%     is then - of course - the makespan.

num_jobs = 22; % num_stuff = 20;
num_workers = 250;  % bin_capacity = 250;
resource = [42,69,67,57,93,90,38,36,45,42,33,79,27,57,44,84,86,92,46,38,85,33];
duration = [1 | i in 1..num_jobs];
max_time = 250; % optimal: 6
allow_idle = true;
collect_workers = false;
do_precendences = false;
num_precedences = 1;
precedences = array2d(1..num_precedences, 1..2, 
[ 
  0,0 % dummy
]);
