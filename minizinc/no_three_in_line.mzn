% """
% In mathematics, in the area of discrete geometry, the no-three-in-line-problem, 
% introduced by Henry Dudeney in 1917, asks for the maximum number of points 
% that can be placed in the n Ã— n grid so that no three points are collinear. 
% This number is at most 2n, since if 2n + 1 points are placed in the grid some 
% row will contain three points.
