% Bin packing as a scheduling problem.
%
% Here we see the bin packing as a scheduling problem (with
% assignments) as follows:
%   - the number of things to pack is the number of jobs
%   - the capacity of each bin is the number of workers
%   - the weight/height of each thing is the resource
%   - all durations is set to 1
%   - max_time is the number of workers
%   - the minimum number of bins to use (to be minimized) 
%     is then - of course - the makespan.
