% [From Thinking Mathematically, p. 172]
% 
% George Glaeser of Strasbourg put a set of dominoes more or less randomly 
% in a flat tray and took a photograph. The exposure was not correct, and 
% although the numbers can be discerned, the positions of the individual 
% dominoes cannot.
% 
% Each domino is a rectangle composed of two adjacent squares, each with a 
% number. In the set there is only one domino with each combination of 
% numbers from the numbers 0 through 6. For example, there is one domino 
% with 2,3, and one with 4,4.
% 
% Can you reconstruct the dominoes?
