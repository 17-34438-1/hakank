  Set puzzle in Picat.

  From http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Set_puzzle
  """
  Set Puzzles are created with a deck of cards from the Set Gameâ„¢. The object of 
  the puzzle is to find sets of 3 cards in a rectangle of cards that have been 
  dealt face up. There are 81 cards in a deck. Each card contains a unique variation 
  of the following four features: color, symbol, number and shading.

  there are three colors
    red, green, or purple 

  there are three symbols
    oval, squiggle, or diamond 

  there is a number of symbols on the card
    one, two, or three 

  there are three shadings
    solid, open, or striped 

  Three cards form a set if each feature is 
      - either the same on each card, or 
      - is different on each card. 
  For instance: all 3 cards are red, all 3 cards have a different 
  symbol, all 3 cards have a different number of symbols, all 3 cards are striped.

  There are two degrees of difficulty: basic and advanced. The basic mode deals 9 
  cards, that contain exactly 4 sets; the advanced mode deals 12 cards that contain 
  exactly 6 sets. When creating sets you may use the same card more than once.

  The task

  Is to write code that deals the cards (9 or 12, depending on selected mode) from a 
  shuffled deck in which the total number of sets that could be found is 4 (or 6, 
  respectively); and print the contents of the cards and the sets. For instance:

  DEALT 9 CARDS:

    green, one, oval, striped 
    green, one, diamond, open 
    green, one, diamond, striped 
    green, one, diamond, solid 
    purple, one, diamond, open 
    purple, two, squiggle, open 
    purple, three, oval, open 
    red, three, oval, open 
    red, three, diamond, solid 

  CONTAINING 4 SETS:

    green, one, oval, striped 
    purple, two, squiggle, open 
    red, three, diamond, solid 
    green, one, diamond, open 
    green, one, diamond, striped 
    green, one, diamond, solid 
    green, one, diamond, open 
    purple, two, squiggle, open 
    red, three, oval, open 
    purple, one, diamond, open 
    purple, two, squiggle, open 
    purple, three, oval, open
