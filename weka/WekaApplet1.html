For general information about my Weka applets, go <a href="/weka/">here</a>.
This applet consists just of two things:
<ul>
 <li> Select data set<br>
In the field <i>Data set (URL):</i>, you may give an URL to the data 
set, an ARFF-file<br> 
Just insert the URL in to the field, e.g. <pre>
http://www.hakank.org/weka/zoo2.arff</pre>
Or maybe just select some of the sample data set in the list 
(<i>Select data set:</i>).<br>
The ARFF file format is a specific format for defining the data set. See 
the information <a href="/weka/index.html#ARFF">here</a> about the sample 
data sets I have provided.<br>
<li> algorithm (select in the list).<br>
Weka have a lot of different algorithms for classifying data, of which some
is used in this applet. In "the real" Weka, the algorithms has a lot of interesting options. Here I just use the default values.
<br><br>
The result text is some of the result which the real Weka system shows (in
approximately the same way).
  <br><br>
<li>
Please note that the test is on the training set itself, i.e. the program don't do cross validation or percentage split. This means that the statistics is better than under real testing.
</ul>
